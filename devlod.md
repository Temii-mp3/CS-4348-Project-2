I took a look at the project and have a basice idea about what i need to do. The premise of the project is to use semaphores to ensure proper communcation between threads that use a shared resource. For this project i will be using java because i use c++ in the last project and would like to get experience with java as well. In order to properly start, i need to plan where semaphores will be needed, i will create a basic program first to test out the syntax of java and have a basic idea of what im supposed to do. The goal for this session is to have all files uploaded to github and a have a basic understanding of the project.
